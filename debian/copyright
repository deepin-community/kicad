 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
    or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
    including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
    work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
    a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
    in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
    or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
    below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
    each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
    together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the
    purposes of this License.
 .
 c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
    including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
    have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
    License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
    works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
    Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
    License.
 .
 d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
    of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer
    of ownership.
 .
 e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
    selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
    Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
 g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
    in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
    other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
    otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
    (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
    entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
    (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
    broadcast.
 .
 h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
    this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
    scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
    expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
    writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
    dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
    in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
    cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
    analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
    of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional
    work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
    it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
    or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
    or artistic work.
 .
 i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
    who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
    the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
    exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
    communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
    individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
    or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the
    Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
    the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
 .
 k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
    limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
    reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
    performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
    or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations
    or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
    protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
 .
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
    original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
    work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
    indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,
 .
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
 i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
    the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
    licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
    right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
    granted under this License;
 .
 ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
     right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
     scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
     such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
     License; and,
 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
      royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
      member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
      schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
      under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
 or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
 by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
    subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
    When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
    effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
    Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
    this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
    required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
    notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
    the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
    the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
    Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
    of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
    intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
    subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a
    sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or
    by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
    title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
    the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
    unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the
    case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
    Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
    "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
    required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
    minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
    of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
    by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
    or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.
 .
 d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
    Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
    make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
 DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
    IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
    entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
    the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
    If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
    rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
    intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

License: CC-BY-SA-4.0
 Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
 be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
 To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
 terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed
 Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 – Definitions.
 .
 a.  Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
     Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
     otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright
     and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
     License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or
     sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed
     Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 b.  Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
     Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance
     with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 c.  BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
     creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as
     essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
 d.  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
     related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
     broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without
     regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this
     Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not
     Copyright and Similar Rights.
 e.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
     of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
     obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
     December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
 f.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.
 g.  License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
     Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public
     License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
 h.  Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
     material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
 i.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
     conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
     Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that
     the Licensor has authority to license.
 j.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
     Public License.
 k.  Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process thati
     requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
     public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
     communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
     public including in ways that members of the public may access the
     material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
 l.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
     from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
     March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
     succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
     world.
 m.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
     this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
 a.  License grant.
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
        Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
        and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply,
        and you do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
        whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
        to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
        modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
        Measures.  For purposes of this Public License, simply making
        modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
        Material.
     5. Downstream recipients.
         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
            Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
            to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
            this Public License.
         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every
            recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
            offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
            Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You
            apply.
         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
            additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
            Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
            so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of
            the Licensed Material.
     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
        endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
        designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b.  Other rights.
     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
        this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
        waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor
        to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
        Rights, but not otherwise.
     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
        waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
        the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
 a.  Attribution.
     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
        must:
         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
            Licensed Material:
          i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
             others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
             requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
         ii. a copyright notice;
        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
         iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
          v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
             reasonably practicable;
         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
            indication of any previous modifications; and
         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
            License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
            Public License.
     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
        Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
        conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
        the required information.
     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
        required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
 .
 b.  ShareAlike.
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
     Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
     1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
        the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible
        License.
     2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
        License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
        Adapted Material.
     3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
        conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
        Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the
        Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
 Your use of the Licensed Material:
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database;
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
    in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
    contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
    and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
    Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
    includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
    known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
 b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
    for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
    exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
    this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
    has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
    damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in
    part, this limitation may not apply to You.
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
    closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
    Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
    License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
    automatically.
 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
       cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
    the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
    Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
    Public License.
 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
    and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
    of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission
    under this Public License.
 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
    shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
    enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
 c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
    to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
 d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
    limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
    the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
    or authority.
