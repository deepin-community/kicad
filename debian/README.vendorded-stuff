KiCad 7 comes with vendored packaged which are used within the build process.
Not all of the used upstream vendored packages are available in Debian, and
some of them are not needed within the build in Debian as they are specific
for the Windows OS.

The folder thirdparty/ is containing all the vendored software. The various
used upstream software is not always a complete copy of the upstream project!

This file is collecting the current state and will hold information about
the things that need to happen from POV of Debian.
