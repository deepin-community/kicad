== Introduction to GerbView

GerbView is a Gerber file (RS-274X format) and Excellon drill file viewer. Up to 32 files can be
displayed at once.

For more information about the Gerber file format please read
http://www.ucamco.com/files/downloads/file/81/the_gerber_file_format_specification.pdf[the Gerber File Format Specification].
Details about drill file format can be found at

=== Layers Manager

image::images/gerbview_layer_manager.png[scaledwidth="40%",alt="gerbview_layer_manager_png"]

The Layers Manager controls and displays visibility of all layers. An arrow
indicates the active layer, and each layer can be shown or hidden with
the checkboxes.

Mouse button assignments:

* Left click: select the active layer
* Right click: show/hide/sort layers options
* Middle click or double click (on color swatch): select the layer color

The Layers tab allows you to control the visibility and color of all loaded
Gerber and drill layers.  The Items tab allows you to control the color and
display of the grid, D Codes, and negative objects.

== Commands in menu bar

=== File menu

image::images/gerbview_file_menu.png[scaledwidth="45%",alt="gerbview_file_menu_png"]

* *Export to PCB Editor* is a limited capability to export Gerber files into a KiCad PCB. The final
  result depends on what features of the RS-274X format are used in the original Gerber files:
  rasterized items cannot be converted (typically negative objects), flashed items are converted to
  vias, lines are converted to track segments (or graphic lines for non-copper layers).

=== Tools menu

image::images/gerbview_tools_menu.png[scaledwidth="25%",alt="gerbview_tools_menu_png"]

* *List DCodes* shows the D Code information for all layers.
* *Show Source* displays the Gerber file contents of the active layer in a text editor.
* *Measure Tool* allows measuring the distance between two points.
* *Clear Current Layer* erases the contents of the active layer.

== Printing

To print layers, use the
image:images/icons/print_button_24.png[print_button_png]
icon or the *File -> Print* menu.

[CAUTION]
========================================
Be sure items are inside the printable area. Use
image:images/icons/sheetset_24.png[sheetset_png] to select a
suitable page format.

Note that many photoplotters support a large plottable area, much
bigger than the page sizes used by most printers. Moving the entire
layer set may be required.
