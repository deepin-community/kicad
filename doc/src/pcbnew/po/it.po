"The purpose served by the extruded outlines is to give the mechanical "
"designer some idea of the location and physical space occupied by each "
"component. In a typical scenario the mechanical designer will replace some "
"of the crude outlines with more detailed mechanical models, for example when "
"checking to ensure that a right-angle mounted LED will fit into a hole on a "
"panel. In most situations the accuracy of an outline doesn't matter, but it "
"is good practice to create outlines which convey the best mechanical "
"information possible. In a few instances a user may wish to fit the "
"component into a case with very little excess space, for example in a "
"portable music player. In such a situation, if most extruded outlines are a "
"good enough representation of components then the mechanical designer may "
"only have to replace very few models while designing the case. If the "
"outlines are not a reliable reflection of reality then the mechanical "
"designer will waste a lot of time replacing models to ensure a good fit. "
"After all, if you put garbage in you can expect garbage to come out. If you "
"put in good information, you can be confident of good results."

"Lo scopo dei profili estrusi è dare al progettista meccanico un'idea della "
"posizione e dello spazio fisico occupati da ogni componente. In un tipico "
"scenario il progettista meccanico sostituirà alcuni profili grezzi con "
"modelli meccanici più dettagliati, per esempio durante la verifica che un "
"LED montato angolato a destra entri in un foro in un pannello. In molte "
"situazioni l'accuratezza di un profilo non è importante, ma è considerata "
"buona pratica creare profili che corrispondano alle informazioni meccaniche "
"il più possibile. In alcuni casi un utente potrebbe voler inserire il "
"componente in uno scatolo con poco spazio, per esempio in un lettore audio "
"digitale portatile. In tale situazione, se la maggior parte dei profili "
"estrusi sono abbastanza rappresentativi dei componenti, allora il "
"progettista meccanico dovrà rimpiazzare solo pochi modelli durante la "
"progettazione della scatola. Se i profili non sono una rappresentazione "
"affidabile della realtà allora il progettista meccanico dovrà perdere molto "
"tempo per rimpiazzare i modelli per assicurarsi che il tutto riesca a stare "
"dentro il contenitore. Inserendo dati spazzatura si otterrà spazzatura in "
"uscita. Se si inseriscono dati affidabili, ci si può aspettare ovviamente "
"migliori risultati."

"| Setting | Description\n"
"| Arc/circle approximated by segments\n"
"  | In some situations, KiCad must use a series of straight line segments to approximate round\n"
"    shapes such as those of arcs and circles.  This setting controls the maximum error allowed by\n"
"    this approximation: in other words, the maximum distance between a point on one of these line\n"
"    segments and the true shape of the arc or circle.  Setting this to a lower number than the\n"
"    default value of 0.005mm will result in smoother shapes, but can be very slow on larger boards.\n"
"    The default value typically results in arc approximation error that is not detectable in the\n"
"    manufactured board due to manufacturing tolerances.\n"
"| Allow fillets outside zone outline\n"
"  | Zones can have fillets (rounded corners) added in the Zone Properties dialog.  By default, no\n"
"    zone copper, including fillets, is allowed outside the zone outline.  This effectively means\n"
"    that inside corners of the zone outline will not be filleted even when a fillet is configured.\n"
"    By enabling this setting, inside corners of the zone outline will be filleted even though this\n"
"    results in copper from the zone extending outside the zone outline.\n"
"| Min thermal relief spoke count\n"
"  | This sets the minimum acceptable number of thermal relief spokes connecting a pad to a\n"
"    zone. A DRC violation will be generated if this constraint is violated.\n"
"| Include stackup height in track length calculations\n"
"  | By default, the height of the stackup is used to calculate the additional length of a track\n"
"    that travels through vias from one layer to another.  This calculation relies on the board\n"
"    stackup height being correctly configured.  In some situations, it is preferable to ignore the\n"
