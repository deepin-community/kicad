### Notes

Version clause must be the first clause.  It indicates the syntax version of the file so that 
future rules parsers can perform automatic updates.  It should be
set to "1".

Rules should be ordered by specificity.  Later rules take
precedence over earlier rules; once a matching rule is found
no further rules will be checked.
